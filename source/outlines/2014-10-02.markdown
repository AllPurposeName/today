## Everyone

No warmup today since it's project delivery/work day.

## 1406

It seems like you need work time more than anything else, so we're not going to
schedule sessions today. If you need some feedback/help then create an issue on your
project and mention `@jcasimir`. You can work out of Market Street.

Meet with Jeff near the 3D Printer at Market.

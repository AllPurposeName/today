## Posse Meetup Time

Today, you'll meet in your new posses. Every posse will have a least one new member in it. So, you'll have to update some things and reintroduce yourselves.

### Introduce yourself to your posse by answering the following questions

  * Name and cohort?
  * Where are you from originally?
  * What brought you to Turing?
  * What excites you most about the next six weeks at Turing?
  * What do you think you dream job would be after graduating from Turing?
  * What non-programming experience in your life do you think has best prepared you for being a developer?

### Take care of administrative affairs

  * Create a Google Calendar for your posse. You can use this calendar to request pairing sessions, set posse meetups, etc.
  * Invite all posse members (students and mentors) to the calendar.
  * Create and share a Google Doc to store contact info for your posse: name, email, Twitter, Github, phone, blogâ€¦
  * Join or create a Slack channel for your posse

### Find some common ground

  * Your posse is named after a favorite computer scientist. Who is this person and why are their contributions significant?
  * What is a core value of your posse? Some examples: grit, perseverance. Why is this value important to being a developer?

### Gather some intelligence

  * Use Google, Github, Twitter, etc. to research your posse mentors.

### Pass down some wisdom

  * What should 1409 know about life at Turing? (e.g. time management, the extra set of bathrooms on the first floor)
  * What should 1407 know about module two?

### Ideabox TDD (9:00-12:00)

Use Classroom A to complete this exercise. Sorry that, because of assessments,
there won't be anyone dedicated to questions during your work time.

It's time to start your most sizable tutorial yet,
[IdeaBox-TDD](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/ideabox/tdd_minitest.html).

Please spend the morning working on it with the pair below and finish it by
the start of the day tomorrow.

### Enumerable Methods (1:00-4:00)

Start in Classroom A with Rachel. Lesson outline [here](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/enumerable_methods.markdown). 

#### Introduction

Then let's have a quick chat about the overarching concepts behind the Enumerable methods.

* Programming is about collections
* *Iterating* over a collection: `each`, `map`/`collect`, `inject`, `sort_by`
* *Filtering* a collection: `select`, `detect`, `min`, `max`
* Typically take a block and run it once for each element
* The right enumerable method can save you time/effort
* But everything can be done with `each`

#### Exercises in Pairs

Once we've finished the group discussion you should dive into
[these enumerable exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/enums-exercises)

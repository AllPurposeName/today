## All

It's Thursday and Thursday is JavaScript day.

Write a function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount of money, given an array of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2:

```js
1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.
```

The order of coins does not matter:

```js
1+1+2 == 2+1+1
```

Also, assume that you have an infinite ammount of coins.

Your function should take an amount to change and an array of unique denominations for the coins:

```js
countChange(4, [1,2]) // => 3
countChange(10, [5,2,3]) // => 4
```

```
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood...

People say I'm not okay

I've never known...

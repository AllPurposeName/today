### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Build a solution for the problem of merging three sorted collection.

Imagine we have three sets:

* a: [1,4,9]
* b: [2,3,5]
* c: [6,7,8]

Then the merge should produce [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

Try to solve a small problem first. Use pseudocode to separate the algorithmic
thinking from the implementation.

Post your solutions in #warmup-answers

## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

Can you implement `flatten` without using, uhm, `Array#flatten`? It should be able to handle nested arrays infinitely deep.

* If you did it without money patching `Array`, can you do it with monkey patching? (And vice versa, of course.)
* Can you do it in JavaScript?

We all did it on Friday and we'll show you our approaches at 8:55.

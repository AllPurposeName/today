From Rachel's [personal site](http://rachelcope.io/):

*I am a UX and product designer at thoughtbot in Denver who loves human psychology (typical “INFJ”), beauty, and rendering the abstract concrete. Prior to thoughtbot, I did freelance interactive design, co-founded a web startup to combat child malnutrition, and spent 2 years teaching in Guatemala. I’m inspired by the mountains, stimulating conversation, delicious food, and spending time with good friends and family. Currently on my playlist: Mozart, The Kinks, Andrew Bird, Gregorian Chants, Lorde. Currently reading: "Human Centered Design" by IDEO and "On Looking" by Alexandra Horowitz"*

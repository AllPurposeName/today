### Intro to CSVs (9:00 - 10:00)

Meet with Steve in Classroom C to [return to one of your favorite lessons and talk about CSVs](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/file_io_and_csvs.markdown).

### EventManager (10:00 - 2:00)

Let's put your CSV knowledge into practice. You have some time to dive into the [EventManager Tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html).

Some things to keep in mind:

* You won't finish the tutorial, that's ok
* This work time is about exposure and learning, not mastery and perfect code
* Go slow enough that you understand / think critically about all your code
* Don't write tests. This is exposure, not high quality code. You'll do plenty of testing in SalesEngine.
* Feel free to play and dive deeper if something catches your eye

Mike will hang out in the workspace for your questions.

### EventManager Discussion and Recap (2:00 - 2:30)

Join Mike in Classroom A to discuss your observations and answer any big picture questions that came out of EventManager.

### Getting Started with SalesEngine (2:30 - 3:00)

Then the moment you've been waiting for. Continue with Steve in A to [kickoff SalesEngine](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/sales_engine.html).

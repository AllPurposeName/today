## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

Write a program that:

* Generates the first 100 numbers in the [Fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
* Prints them out one-by-one as it generates them
* Outputs whether they are or are not prime numbers

For example:

```
1. 0

2. 1

3. 1

4. 2 (prime)

5. 3 (prime)

6. 5 (prime)

7. 8

8. 13 (prime)
```

Post your solution in #warmup-answers by 9:00 AM with your full posse name. 
The most interesting/creative/obfuscated solutions will receive an arbitrary number of points.

* Justin Pease & Alex Tideman

__60 minutes: Code Review__

Spend the first 30 minutes reviewing one partner's code, then switch and
review the other partner's code for 30 minutes.

Here are some things we'd especially like to look for:

* Does the solution work?
* Is there evidence of iterative development toward a solution?
* Are there tests included?
* Do the tests exercise multiple layers of complexity and functionality?
(simple to harder cases; covering all the methods or components of the
problem, etc.)
* If the solution uses an object-oriented approach, is it divided into
granular methods and classes with clear responsibility?
* Are the objects and methods well-named? Do they actually do the things
described by their names?

__120 minutes: Applying what you've learned__

Now that we've had a chance to recap the assignment and see another
person's solution, let's rework credit check
and see if we can come up with any new approaches to the problem.

Spend the next 120-ish minutes working with your pair on a new credit
check solution (from scratch). Keep in mind the same principles we
discussed when first presenting the assignment â€” work iteratively from a
small/naive solution toward something more sophisticated.

Don't forget to take Pomodoros.

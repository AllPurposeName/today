### Pub/Sub on the Server (9:00 - 10:30)

Pub/Sub is an architectural pattern useful for building real-time web
apps. Join Steve in Classroom C to talk about the server-side
implications of pubsub.

### Pub/Sub on the Client (10:30 - 12:00)

Now let's jump over to the Client side and see what this looks like.
Stick with Steve in Classroom C.

### Project Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

Keep working on those community projects.

(Steve TBD -- anything else that should go here?)

### Consuming APIs (9:00 - 12:00)

Public or Semi-Public APIs are ubiquitous on the web these days -- if
your startup isn't platform-atized via it's sweet REST API, what are you
even doing with your life? Join Jorge in Classroom B to talk about
accessing the wonderful world of APIs.

### Project Work Time (1:00 - 4:00)

Your individual projects miss you. Get back to work on
tinder-for-beekeepers or whatever it is you are doing.

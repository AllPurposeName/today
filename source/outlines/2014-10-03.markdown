repetition markers in regular expressions
* Explain a project you've completed and what went right and what went wrong
* Extract a technique that you used in a project or tutorial and explore it a
bit more deeply, like "How to read and write CSV files from Ruby"

Remember that you don't need to be an expert in something to explain it.

### Technical Blogging (2:15-3:30)

This afternoon we'd like you to create and write a post for a technical blog.

*[Add the URL for your production post for week of 2014-09-26.markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/blogging/2014-09-26.markdown)*.

#### Platform Options

It really doesn't matter what platform you use. Here are a few options:

* [Our small Middleman (Ruby) app](https://github.com/turingschool/student-blog)
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)

#### Content

Please write and publish a technical blog post on your own
blog. You might consider:

* Exploring/explaining a topic you don't understand well, like the usage of
repetition markers in regular expressions
* Explain a project you've completed and what went right and what went wrong
* Extract a technique that you used in a project or tutorial and explore it a
bit more deeply, like "How to read and write CSV files from Ruby"

Remember that you don't need to be an expert in something to explain it.

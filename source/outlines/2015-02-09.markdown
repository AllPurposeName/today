## 1409

### Jet Fuel: Recap and Refactor (9:00 - 10:45)

#### Phase One: Pair Code Review

(15 minutes: 9:00 - 9:15)

Spend 15 minutes reviewing your partners code.

* Are any methods unclear to you?
* Can any methods be refactored? Do they seem overly verbose?
* Are there any private methods that could be extracted?
* Are there any opportunities to push logic down the stack?

You can find everyone's repositories [here](https://github.com/turingschool/intermission-assignments/issues/1).

Open issues on your partners repository pointing to the exact lines you believe could/should be refactored.

#### Phase Two: Refactor

(45 minutes: 9:15 - 10:00)

As a pair, choose a method to refactor based on the issues you opened earlier.

* Does this method have a test? If not, write one first.
* Refactor the method, ensuring the test passes.

#### Phase Three: Instructor Discussion

(45 minutes: 10:00 - 10:45)

##### With Horace

Join Horace in the Big Workspace to discuss challenges using background workers or creating a wrapper gem.

##### With Steve

### Mocking and Stubbing (10:45 - 12:00)

Meet up with Horace in Classroom B to discuss the finer points of testing things that seem hard to test.

### JavaScript Book Club and General Discussion (1:00 - 2:00)

### Self-Study (10:00 - 12:00)

So, it's relatively easy to ask you to respect the Friday since you're
all between projects. But that's all the more reason to take a little
bit of time to sharpen your tools.

There won't be one-on-ones today.

* Consider working through the [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/)
  workshops. **Steve** is clearing his schedule to exclusively answer
  JavaScript questions exclusively today.
* Consider working on the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) to
  sharpen your Ruby skills.
* Consider getting better with your tools. Take a look at
  [ShortcutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/) to learn your way around
  your editor.
* Consider taking one or more [Exercism](http://exercism.io) exercises
  in the language of your choice.
* We talked with Thoughtworks yesterday and they prefer that their
  applicants complete a challenge in Java. Consider tackling some Java
  today with [this course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/).

  umm, 3D pritner to discuss, umm, 3D printing.

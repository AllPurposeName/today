## All

### Posse Time (8:30 - 9:00)

When Slack acquired ScreenHero, they shut down registrationsâ€”but existing users can still invite new users. Please invite the 1502 members in your posse. After they have registered, they can fill out the form below to have us pay for their account.

* [How to invite people to ScreenHero](http://blog.screenhero.com/post/110852538851/already-a-screenhero-user-heres-how-to-invite)
* [1502: Fill out this form once you have your account](https://docs.google.com/a/casimircreative.com/forms/d/1wJUbwB0doGgeyp9rGDt14aHtNE8nGlRueoSe_qpVRr4/viewform)

### Electives (2:30 - 4:00)

Let's *all* meet in the workspace at 2:30 to introduce the next round of electives.

#### Build a Web Server with Josh Cheek

In this class, we will understand the web and HTTP by building a webs erver.

You will need to have familiarity with classes, methods, and string manipulation. You might get to work with blocks, unless I can think of an elegant way to avoid them.

We will see what makes a request a GET or POST request, what headers and cookies actually are, where HTML fits into all of this, how a redirect works, etc.

As usual, you'll get my flavor of TDD and design.

#### Resuscitating an Open Source Project with Jeff

A few years ago I wrote [a gem named Draper](https://github.com/drapergem/draper). Since then it's
fallen into a bit of disrepair. For this three-class elective we'll try to get it
back on track.

Coming in to this elective you need to:

* Understand the basics of Rails applications (1409 yes, 1410 yes, 1412 maybe)
* Be comfortable with TDD
* Be ready for a lot of unguided work (aka this is not a follow-along-with-what-I-tell-you kind of class)
* Have a desire to dig into to some fucked up parts of Rails
* Be up for writing documentation

For this elective I'd like to have no more than *eight people*.

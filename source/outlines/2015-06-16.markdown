### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

One of the skills you most need to develop over the next few weeks is your "algorithmic thinking." The quintessential CS problem for algorithm practice is sorting data.

Without referencing other sources, write pseudocode for an algorithm for sorting a collection of numbers. Think about the simplest cases first, like sets of one, two, and three numbers.
Generate a set of ten random numbers (use rand(100)) and implement your algorithm in code. Does it work? If not, go back to modify the pseudocode first, then the implementation code second.

### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

Okay, it's a special day in the module. It's time to take a 20 minute dip into a language you've never played with before.

Head over to [this site](http://learnxinyminutes.com/) and try out a language you've never used before. You might have to do some installation and setup, so we'll give you some time on Friday to experiment as well.

Some suggestions:

* Clojure
* Rust
* Elixir
* Nim

In `#warmup-answers`, please post your reflections: What stuck you as "Oh, that's cool?" and what made you think "Huh?"

## All

### Self-Study (9:00 - 11:00)

This morning, please _respect the Friday_ and do not work on your project. You should, instead, choose one or more of the following:

### Join a Study Group

* **Will and Andy** are running a study group on [Tmux][tmux] and [Vim][]. Seek them out if you want to become a command line wizard.
* **David and Travis** are running a [Github][] study group—this session is *highly recommended* for 1410.

[Github]: http://github.com
[tmux]: http://tmux.sourceforge.net/
[Vim]: http://www.vim.org/

(Let Steve know if you'd like to run a study group.)

### Work with a Peer Mentor

* **Robert, Jonmichael, Watts, and Will** have offered to mentor students from 1407, 1409, and 1410. Seek them out if there is something you're struggling with or if you want to take on a new challenge. Pick an Exercism? Tackle a problem on Project Euler? Try to solve one of those JavaScript problems from yesterday?

### Technical Blogging

* Have you figured something out? Write a technical blog post. [Check out some of the posts written by your fellow students this week.](https://github.com/turingschool/student_blogging/blob/master/week%20of%202014-10-27.markdown) Keep in mind, that someone down the road will struggle with some concept you've recently conquered.

Submit a pull request here with [information about your post](https://github.com/turingschool/student_blogging).

### Experiment with New Tools

* Consider taking [Vim][] for a spin. Not into Vim? What about TextMate, Emacs, Chocolate?
* Level up your git skills with Scott Chacon's [_Pro Git_](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
* Try out a visual git tool like [Github for Mac][ghfm], [GitX][gitx], [Tower][].
* Find a tool that allows you to use multiple clipboards ([Keyboard Maestro][km], [Flycut][fc]).
* Play with [RubyMine][rm]—a Ruby/Rails IDE.

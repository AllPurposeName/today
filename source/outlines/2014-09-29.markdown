### Warmup (8:30-9:00)

Learn X in Y Minutes: Head over to [this site](http://learnxinyminutes.com/) and try out a language you've never used before. You might have to do some installation and setup, so we'll give you some time tomorrow to experiment as well.

Some suggestions:

* F#
* Go
* Clojure
* Lua

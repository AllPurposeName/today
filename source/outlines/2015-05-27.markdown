### WarmUp (8:30 - 9:00)

1505ers, can you help your Posse complete FizzBuzz?

* Go through the numbers 0 through 100 inclusive.
* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "Semicolons Rule"
* Otherwise, print the number.

Post your solution in #warmup-answers with your full posse name to receive 15 points. Cut-off is 9:00 am.
(So I can copy and paste when awarding points. Please capitalize. It makes my life easier.)

## All

### Warm Up (8:30 - 8:50)

**In your posses, solve [this problem from Project Euler][pe]:**

*n*! means *n* × (*n* − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

(This is actually one of those cases where a functional language like Clojure or JavaScript can be useful. See if you can solve it in a functional language.)

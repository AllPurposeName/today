### Technical Blogging (2:15-3:30)

This afternoon we'd like you to create and write a post for a technical blog.

#### Platform Options

It really doesn't matter what platform you use. Here are a few options:

* [Our small Middleman (Ruby) app](https://github.com/turingschool/student-blog)
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)

#### Content - 1406

If you're in 1406, please get back together with your team and both (a) write a
blog post explaining and exploring your "The Pivot" projects and (b) create an
eight-or-fewer minute screencast video showing off both the app and the code. These
four posts will be published on the Turing.io blog.

#### Content - 1407 & 1409

For 1407 and 1409, please write and publish a technical blog post on your own
blog. You might consider:

* Exploring/explaining a topic you don't understand well, like the usage of
repetition markers in regular expressions
* Explain a project you've completed and what went right and what went wrong
* Extract a technique that you used in a project or tutorial and explore it a
bit more deeply, like "How to read and write CSV files from Ruby"

Remember that you don't need to be an expert in something to explain it.

When it's up in production, add your URL to this document:

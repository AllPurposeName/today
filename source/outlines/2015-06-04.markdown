### Warm Up (8:30 - 9:00)

You are in a room with 100 light switches in a line along the wall.  
They all start in the OFF position.  
 
When you first enter the room, you walk down the line of all 100 switches
and change each one to the ON position.  
 
Then you start from the beginning again, this time changing
the position of every second switch (e.g. #2, #4, #6...).  
If it was ON, now it is OFF and if it was OFF, now it is ON.
 
Then you start from the beginning again and change every THIRD switch (e.g. #3, #6, #9…)...

...then again for every FOURTH switch (e.g. #4, #8, #12…) ...

...then again for every FIFTH switch...

...and so on until you've made 100 trips.
 
Write a program that identifies which switches will be in the ON position after this is completed.

Post your solution in #warmup-answers by 9:00 AM with your full posse name. 
The most interesting/creative/obfuscated solutions will receive an arbitrary number of points.

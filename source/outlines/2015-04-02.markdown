### Warm-Up (8:30 - 8:50)

##### Turing Struct

Let's create a Turing Struct ruby class which wraps a hash and exposes
its keys as methods.

A Turing Struct accepts a hash when it's initialized, e.g.:

```
TuringStruct.new({my: "hash"})
```

When we provide a hash to a TuringStruct, we can then ask it for the
keys of that hash as if they were methods:

```
struct = TuringStruct.new({some: "value", another: "thing"})
struct.some
# => "value"
struct.another
# => "thing"
```

__Extension:__ Once you have a working struct, see what it would take to allow
method-chaining to retrieve nested hash data:

```
struct = TuringStruct.new({nested: {another: "hash"})
struct.nested.another
# => "hash"
```
